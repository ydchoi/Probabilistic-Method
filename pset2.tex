% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{solution}
Consider a random $n \times n$ matrix, $M_{n}$, obtained 
by assigning each entry independently either $1$ or $0$, where the probability 
of assigning $1$ is $p$. Let $X$ be a random variable, which counts
number of $1$s in the matrix, and $Y$ be a random variable, which counts 
number of $3 \times 3$ submatrices of all $1$s. 
For any $3 \times 3$ submatrix $S$, let $Y_S$ be the
indicator random variable for the event for which the submatrix $S$ has entries of all $1$s,
so that $Y = \sum Y_{S}$. By Linearity of Expectation, we have
\eQb
E[Y] &=& \sum E[Y_S] = {n \choose 3}^2 p^{9}. \\
\eQe 
Clearly, $E[X] = n^2 p$. Therefore, again by Linearity of Expectation, it follows that
\eQb
E[X - Y] &=& n^2 p - {n \choose 3}^2 p^{9} = f(p). 
\eQe
Hence, there exists a random assignment, for which the number of $1$s minus 
the number of $3 \times 3$ submatrices of $1$ is at least $f(p)$.
Fix such a coloring. Select one entry from each submatrix and change to $0$. This leaves
the matrix with at least $f(p)$ entries with $1$. 

\smallskip

We now optimize this result by maximizing $f(p)$ with respect to $p$. Observe that $f$ 
is concave with respect to $p \in [0,1]$. Solving for the local maxima by setting the
first-order derivative equals to $0$, we get that $f$ is maximized at 
$p^* = (\dfrac{n^2}{9{n \choose 3}^2})^{\frac{1}{8}} = (\dfrac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)})^{\frac{1}{4}}$.
Substituting $p^*$ back into $f(p)$, we obtain
\eQb
f(p^*) &=& n^2(\dfrac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)})^{\frac{1}{4}} - {n \choose 3}^2 
\dfrac{n^2}{9 {n \choose 3}^2}(\dfrac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)})^{\frac{1}{4}} \\
&=& \dfrac{8}{9}n^2(\dfrac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)})^{\frac{1}{4}} \\ 
&\sim& \dfrac{8}{9}2^{\frac{1}{4}}n^{\frac{3}{2}}. 
\eQe
Recall that $m(n)$ be the minimum number of $1$ in $n \times n$ matrix, such that
there must exist a $3 \times 3$ submatrix of all $1$s.
We have shown that $m(n) = \Omega(n^{\frac{3}{2}})$.

\begin{solution}
Note that we use the langauge of $n-$uniform hypergraph, which is an equivalent problem 
as the problem under consideration.
Before preceeding with the main part of the proof, we define an object, called
a conflicting pair, in a two-coloring scheme.  
We say that an ordered pair of edges $(e,f)$ a conflicting pair, if
$e$ is monochromatic with some color $k$, and for some $v \in e \cap f$,
$f \setminus \{ v \}$ is monochromatic
with the color  not $k$. We call the vertex $v$ the peacebreaker of $(e,f)$. 

\smallskip

We now consider the randomized algorithm. Fix $(e,f)$ an ordered pair of edges from 
the hypergraph.
Notice that the algorithm will
fail, if, after the initial coloring, $(e,f)$ is a conflicting pair with 
a peacebreaker $v$, and at the second stage chooses the peacebreaker $v$ 
to flip its color, exactly when it reviews $e$. The event just described, which 
we denote as $T_{(e,f)}$,
is hence a sufficient condition for a failure to occur. Therefore, the probability
of $T_{(e,f)}$ will serve as an upper bound to the failure probability. Note that
the probability of $T_{(e,f)}$ is given by
\eQb
P(T_{(e,f)}) &=&  
P(\{ (e,f) \text{ is a conflicting pair after the initial coloring} \}) \\ 
&\cdot& P(\{ v \text{ is chosen at the review of $e$ } \} | 
\{ (e,f) \text{ is a conflicting pair after the initial coloring} \}) \\
&\leq& 2^{2-2n} n^{-1}. 
\eQe
One should note that the last quantity is an inequality, as it might be that
there is a no intersection between $e$ and $f$ to begin with, which gives $0$
probability for $(e,f)$ being a conflicting pair after the initial coloring. 
The equality is achieved when $e$ and $f$ share exactly one vertex. 
As there are $m^2$ ordered pairs of edges in the hypergraph, by the subadditivity of
probability, we obtain
\eQb
P(\{ \text{ failure probability }\})  
&\leq& P(\bigcup_{(e,f) \in E\times E} T_{(e,f)}) \\ 
&\leq& \sum_{(e,f) \in E \times E} P(T_{(e,f)} ) \\ 
&\leq& m^2 2^{2 - 2n} n^{-1}, \\
\eQe
where $E$ denotes the edge set. If $m^2 2^{2 -2n}n^{-1} < 1$, we can ensure that
the failure probability is less than $1$. Substituting $2^{n-1}k$ for $m$, we have
\eQb
(2^{n-1}k)^2 2^{2-2n} n^{-1} < 1,
\eQe
which is equivalent to $ k < \sqrt{n}$. Hence, by taking $k = \sqrt{n} - 1$, we can
have a failure probability less than $1$. We have shown that $k = \Omega(\sqrt{ n})$.
